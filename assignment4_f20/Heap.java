	          the priority (frequency counter) and the array subscript (slot).
	          We may have duplicate priorities being inserted 
	      return: void
	      effect: the heap size goes up one
	    delMin
	      in: nothing
	      return: nothing
	      effect: the heap size goes down one, the element at the root is removed
	    getMin
	      in: nothing
	      return: a CacheFrame object (the one in slot 1 on the array)
	      effect: no change in heap state
	    size
	      in: nothing
	      return: integer 0 or greater, the count of the number of elements in the heap
	      effect: no change in heap state
	    incELt
	      in: a CacheFrame object
	      return: nothing
	      effect: frequency counter (priority) in the CacheFrame object is incremented by 1
	              heap state is altered by perhaps the indicated element being bubbled down
	              also, slot numbers in moved heap elements change to reflect new locations
	    decElt
	      in: a CacheFrame object
	      return: nothing
	      effect: frequency counter (priority) in the CacheFrame object is decreased by 1
	              heap state is altered by perhaps the indicated element being bubbled up
	              also, slot numbers in moved heap elements change to reflect new locations
	              error: do no frequency change is the CacheFrame object already has priority 1
	              (all priorities must be 1 or greater).
